            // tell us to use the buffer in cases where the current write would fill the buffer, but the remaining data is small
            // enough such that subsequent operations can use the buffer again.
            //

            // Determine whether or not to buffer according to the heuristic (below).
            // If we decided to use the buffer:
            //     Copy as much user data as we can into the buffer.

            //     Otherwise, write the buffer out.
            //     Copy the rest of user data into the now cleared buffer (no need to write out the buffer again as the heuristic
            //     will prevent it from being filled twice).

            //     Can the data already in the buffer and current user data be combines to a single write
            //     by allocating a "shadow" buffer of up to twice the size of _bufferSize (up to a limit to avoid LOH)?
            //     Yes, it can:
            //         Allocate a larger "shadow" buffer and ensure the buffered  data is moved there.
            //         Copy user data to the shadow buffer.
            //         Write shadow buffer to the underlying stream in a single operation.
            //     No, it cannot (amount of data is still too large):
            //         Write out any data possibly in the buffer.
            //         Write out user data directly.
            //

            // If the subsequent write operation that follows the current write operation will result in a write to the
            // underlying stream in case that we use the buffer in the current write, while it would not have if we avoided
            // using the buffer in the current write (by writing current user data to the underlying stream directly), then we
            // prefer to avoid using the buffer since the corresponding memory copy is wasted (it will not reduce the number
            // of writes to the underlying stream, which is what we are optimising for).

            // determine if it will cause a write to the underlying stream. If the next write is actually larger, our heuristic
